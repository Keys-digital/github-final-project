## Overview
The Simple Interest Calculator allows users to calculate the interest accrued over a given time with minimal input. This is especially useful for quick financial assessments and educational purposes.
## Formula Used
The calculation is performed using the formula:
Simple Interest=p×t×r\text{Simple Interest} = p \times t \times r Simple Interest=p×t×r
Where:
•	p = Principal amount
•	t = Time period in years
•	r = Annual rate of interest (as a decimal)

A calculator that calculates simple interest; given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.
Input:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
Output
   simple interest = p*t*r


## Features
•	Easy-to-use interface for inputting financial details.
•	Accurate and fast computation of simple interest.
•	Lightweight and straightforward implementation.
## Usage
1.	Enter the principal amount (p).
2.	Enter the time period in years (t).
3.	Enter the annual rate of interest (r) as a decimal (e.g., 5% = 0.05).
4.	The calculator will compute and display the simple interest.
